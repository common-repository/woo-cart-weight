== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to change the Weight Suffix? =

You can easily change the weight suffix using the filter below. Please modify the suffix according to your needs and place the code in the **functions.php** file of the theme you are currently using:

'''woo_cart_weight/cart_weight''' – modify displaying weight
'''woo_cart_weight/weight_unit''' – modify the unit

For example:
'''add_filter( 'woo_cart_weight/weight_unit', 'woo_cart_weight_weight_unit' );
/**
 * @param string $weight_unit
 *
 * @retun string
 */
function woo_cart_weight_weight_unit( $weight_unit ) {
    $weight_unit = "%";
    return ( $weight_unit );'''
